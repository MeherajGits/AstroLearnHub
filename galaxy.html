    <h2>Galaxy</h2>
    <p class="text">A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by
        gravity. The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky
        Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million star range in
        size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with
        one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy
        is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and
        nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.Galaxies are
        categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical. spiral, or irregular. Many are thought to
        have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius
        A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.</p>
